TodoSaurus is a website that I've recently coded to organize everything that I need to do.

Running
___________
My source code is included in the files, and requires mysql and a local server to run, but I've included screenshots to give an idea of what the site looks like and does.

About
____________
Todosaurus uses a combination of jquery, backbone.js, and require.js to structure and organize the sites' code. 
Special thanks to Andrew Jiang who created much of the graphics!
